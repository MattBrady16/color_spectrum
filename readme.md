## Color Math

This python program to visually creates a spectrum chosen from color pickers.
Input order is labeled in the window name, and you can look up the RGB values in the console window.
Close one window to close all of them, but all the color pickers must be closed first.

run with py color_spectrum.py

## Color spectrum

This python program visually calculates a 2D spectrum of colors in between 4 user-choosable options!

In the code:
dimX is the number of colors(windows) horizontally across the screen, including inputs
dimY is the number of colors(windows) vertically down the screen, including inputs
screen_width is the number of pixels you want the orchestrated windows to take up horizontally
screen_height is the number of pixels you want the orchestrated windows to take up vertically
the actual size of each window is pretty much just (screen_width / dimX) by (screen_height / dimY)
